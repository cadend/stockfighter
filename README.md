# stockfighter

[Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io/) is a simulated stock market environment with APIs that you can use to issue
orders and query the state of the market. They have levels of increasing difficulty, in which you must satisfy certain
criteria for your clients or be fired.

This is my helper class for the Stockfighter APIs, as well as my code for the levels themselves.
